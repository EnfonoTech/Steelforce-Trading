"""Technical guide at /technical-guide.

Renders `docs/TECHNICAL_GUIDE.md` — the handbook for the client's own system administrator:
what they may configure in the live system, the steps, and where the line is.

The filename has to be `technical_guide.py`, with an underscore, even though the page is
`technical-guide.html`. Frappe builds the controller path by replacing hyphens with
underscores (`frappe/website/page_renderers/template_page.py`, `set_pymodule`), so a
hyphenated controller is never imported at all — and a permission check inside one that is
never imported silently does nothing while the page still serves happily.

Unlike the feature guide at /user-guide, this one needs a login. It is a map of how the live
system is put together, which is not something to leave on the open internet. Guests get a 403
with a login link rather than a redirect.
