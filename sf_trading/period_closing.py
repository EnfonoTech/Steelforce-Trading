"""Open-item gate on the Period Closing Voucher.

A period should not close while documents dated inside it still wait for
their counterpart — an invoice with no delivery, a delivery with no invoice,
a receipt with no bill, a bill with no receipt. Those rows are exactly what
the four open item reports print (sf_trading.open_items), so the gate reuses
that engine rather than judging afresh.

Population vs clearing dates are deliberately different:

    counted:  rows whose document is dated ON OR BEFORE the period end
    cleared:  by any counterpart submitted up to TODAY, whatever its date

so a delivery raised this morning against a March invoice unblocks a March
closing immediately — the accountant clears items, refreshes the draft
voucher, and watches the list shrink. Cutting the clearing at period end
instead would leave the voucher permanently blocked by items that are, in
fact, resolved.

Blocking is per company and OFF by default (`Block Period Closing on Open Items`
on Company). A site that already carries a long tail of open items — an aged
GRNI backlog, say — would otherwise find its first period close refused with no
way through, so the census is shown to everybody and only enforced where
somebody asked for it.

Wired in hooks.py:
    doc_events["Period Closing Voucher"]["before_submit"] -> validate_open_items
    doctype_js["Period Closing Voucher"] -> public/js/period_closing_voucher.js
    after_migrate -> ensure_custom_fields
