"""PM Workflow for Payment Advice — modelled on the live "Payment Request Approval".

permission_manager's PM Workflow is its own approval engine (there is no native Frappe
Workflow record behind it), driven by a `workflow_state` field on the target doctype. This
module creates the equivalent workflow for Payment Advice and tells the rest of sf_trading
whether it is active, because two behaviours have to step aside when it is:

  * `PaymentAdvice.validate_approver()` — the single-approver rule ("only the linked user may
    submit") would fight the workflow, where an Accountant approves documents raised by
    someone else. When a workflow is active the workflow's own permissions decide.
  * the payment automation — with an approval workflow in force, a scheduled run must not
    submit advices behind the approvers' backs. It stops at drafts and records why.

Creation is idempotent and non-destructive: an existing workflow is left exactly as it is
unless `force=1` is passed, so a workflow tuned on site is never overwritten by a deploy.

Shape — four routes out of Draft, decided by what the advice pays for and converging on the
same two final approvals:

    several Purchase Orders   Draft → Purchase Manager ┐
    any overdue invoice       Draft → HO Accounts      ├→ GM or Finance Manager → Bahrain Accountant → Approved
    invoices over BHD 500     Draft ───────────────────┘
    one PO, or BHD 500 or less  Draft ──────────────────────────────────────────────→ Bahrain Accountant → Approved

Branch Head and Purchase Assistant raise on every route, and must attach the paperwork when
they do — the payment slip or supporting statement belongs to whoever raises the advice, not to
an approver further up who has nothing new to attach. The GM and the Finance Manager are
interchangeable for the second approval — either one is enough. Only the Bahrain Accountant's
approval submits the document. Any pending state can be rejected with a comment, which returns
the advice to Draft for correction.

Which route an advice takes is decided in the Payment Advice controller and stored in its
`approval_route` field; the transitions out of Draft test that field and nothing else, because
PM Workflow runs conditions through frappe.safe_eval with almost no globals — a condition
cannot count child rows. Note that Administrator is exempt from condition checks in the engine,
so an advice with no stored route still looks fine when tested as Administrator and offers a
real preparer nothing at all: `migrate_open_advices` exists to stamp the route on advices saved
before the field existed.
