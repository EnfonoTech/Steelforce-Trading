"""Every debit row of a Loyalty Reward Entry journal must name the Sales Invoice it rewards.

The link used to live on the journal header (`Journal Entry.custom_loyalty_sales_invoice`), which
could only ever express one invoice per voucher. A counter does batch one journal across several
customers' invoices, so the link now lives on each Accounts row and the header field is legacy.

The row Custom Field carries `mandatory_depends_on`, which paints the red star and blocks Save in
the desk — but v15 evaluates that expression **client-side only**: the server's mandatory pass
tests a literal `reqd` and nothing else, so REST, `frappe.client.insert`, Data Import, Server
Scripts and background jobs would sail straight past it. This handler is the enforcement; the
Custom Field property is only the UX.

Plain `reqd = 1` on that field is not an option: it is unconditional and server-enforced, so it
would reject every Journal Entry Account row on the site, including the journals ERPNext posts
itself for tax withholding, exchange gain/loss, depreciation and period closing.

It cannot fire on the journals already booked. `run_before_save_methods` dispatches on the action:
`save`/`submit` run `validate`, a cancel runs only `before_cancel`, and an `allow_on_submit` edit
runs only `before_update_after_submit`. So a submitted loyalty journal can still be cancelled, and
its Cost Center still corrected, without anyone being asked for an invoice. Amending one does
re-check it, which is right — an amendment is a fresh draft being entered again.
