"""Keep a Payment Advice in step with the Payment Entry raised from it.

Stamping happens on the Payment Entry's `on_submit` — not `before_submit` as the original
payment_advice app did — so a submit that fails validation cannot leave the advice pointing
at a Payment Entry that never posted. `on_cancel` reverses the stamp and puts the advice back
to Approved, so a corrected payment can be raised again.

The advice fields written here (`payment_entry`, `payment_entry_date`, `status`) all carry
allow_on_submit, and they are written with `db_set` rather than `save()` so the submitted
advice is not re-validated and its `modified` timestamp does not fight a concurrent save.
