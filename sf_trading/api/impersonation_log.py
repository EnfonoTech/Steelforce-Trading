"""Keep the impersonation reason in the audit trail.

Frappe's ``frappe.core.doctype.user.user.impersonate`` writes an Activity Log row
for every impersonation, but the reason the admin typed in the confirm dialog goes
only into the Notification Log sent to the impersonated user — the audit trail
itself never carries it. Anyone auditing the Activity Log later sees *who*
impersonated *whom*, never *why*.

This ``before_insert`` hook closes that gap. The reason travels in the same request
that creates the row (``frappe.form_dict``), so it can be read off the request and
stamped onto the log: full text into the custom field and the Message body, a
trimmed copy appended to the subject so the list view shows it without a drill-in.

Reading the request rather than overriding ``impersonate`` keeps this upgrade-safe:
no core signature is duplicated, and the hook stays inert for every other Activity
Log row (Login, Logout, and anything an app writes itself).
