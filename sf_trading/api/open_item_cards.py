"""Number Card backends for the open item reports.

A workspace shortcut only draws its red count badge when the shortcut points at a
DocType — `shortcut_widget.js` gates the count on `type == "DocType"` and then
counts `link_to` as a DocType. A shortcut aimed at a Script Report therefore has
nothing to count, and no filter or `format` string changes that.

A Report-type Number Card cannot stand in either: its `report_function` offers
only Sum, Average, Minimum and Maximum, so it can total a column but never count
the rows. Counting needs a Custom card, which calls the method named on the card
with the card's own filters and reads `value` off the result
(`number_card_widget.js` -> `get_number_for_custom_card`).
