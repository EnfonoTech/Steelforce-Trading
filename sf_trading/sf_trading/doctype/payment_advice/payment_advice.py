"""Payment Advice — authorise payment against several outstanding documents of one party.

A Payment Advice groups many references (Purchase Invoices, Sales Invoices, Expense Claims…)
for a SINGLE party and carries one authorised `payment_amount`, allocated across those
references in row order. Submitting it records approval; creating the Payment Entry turns it
into money movement. This is what ERPNext's Payment Request cannot express: PR is
one-document-per-request, so it cannot say "pay these nine invoices for this supplier".

Ported from EnfonoTech/payment_advice (MIT) and corrected. Fixes versus that app:
  * Payment Entry takes `company` from THIS document instead of the session user's default.
  * `get_exchange_rate()` is called as (from_currency, to_currency, date) — the original
    passed `company` as the target currency, so every multi-currency advice was wrong.
  * All money maths goes through `flt()`; nulls no longer raise or write None amounts.
  * Allocation stops once the authorised amount is exhausted instead of appending
    zero-allocation reference rows, which ERPNext rejects.
  * The Payment Entry is finished with `set_missing_values()`, so base amounts, party balance
    and unallocated amount are computed by ERPNext instead of left unset.
  * The whitelisted endpoint checks permissions and no longer inserts with
    `ignore_permissions=True`.
  * Party and company account lookups use ERPNext's own helpers.
  * The advice is stamped with its Payment Entry on the PE's `on_submit` (cleared on
    `on_cancel`), not in `before_submit` — a failed submit can no longer leave a false link.
  * Adds a real `status` lifecycle and a `payment_entry` Link (was a free-text Data field).
  * Every user-facing string is translatable.

No SQL is constructed here: reads go through frappe.db.get_value / frappe.get_all.
