"""Purchase Register extended with the receipts nobody has billed yet.

Core's Purchase Register lists Purchase Invoices and nothing else, so the
purchases figure it produces stops at what has been billed. Goods that arrived
and have not been invoiced are real purchases for the trading account, and they
are missing from it.

This report adds them, and adds ONLY the part that is missing. For every
Purchase Receipt in the period it prints the value no Purchase Invoice has
billed, worked out from the same row links the open item reports use
(`sf_trading.open_items`):

    fully billed receipt   -> does not appear at all
    partly billed receipt  -> appears for its remainder only
    unbilled receipt       -> appears in full

The invoice always carries the billed part on its own line, so no value is
counted twice and no value is dropped. A Purchase Invoice that updates stock
needs no receipt and appears once, as an invoice.

WHY THE UNBILLED PART IS MEASURED AS OF THE PERIOD END, NOT TODAY
-----------------------------------------------------------------
`received_items_pending_billing` reconstructs what has been billed from the
counterpart rows filtered by their own posting date, so passing the period end
as `as_on` answers "what was still unbilled on that date". A January receipt
invoiced in February therefore counts as an unbilled January purchase, and the
February invoice counts in February — the value lands in exactly one period and
re-running January next year gives the same answer. Measuring against today
instead would quietly move that value out of January the moment the invoice was
raised, and January would under-report for good.

SCOPE, AND THE ONE PLACE IT PARTS FROM THE OPERATIONAL REPORT
--------------------------------------------------------------
Receipt rows are submitted, non-return, stock-item rows, excluding rows raised
from an invoice (the bill-first flow, where the invoice already carries the
value).

`Received Items Pending Billing` additionally skips receipts marked Closed or
Completed, which is right for a to-do list. This report does NOT, because that
status describes today: a July receipt invoiced in August reads Completed now,
and judging by it would erase the receipt from July even though July closed
with it unbilled. Billed-ness here is established from the dated row links
instead, which is the accurate test and the only one that stays stable when the
period is re-run later. The two reports therefore agree for the current period
and can differ for a closed one — by exactly the receipts invoiced after it
ended, which is the intended behaviour.

RETURNS
-------
A purchase return reduces purchases and reaches the report one of two ways. A
supplier debit note is a Purchase Invoice with is_return and appears on the
invoice side as a negative. Goods sent back on a return Purchase Receipt with
no debit note behind it yet appear as their own negative line, for the part no
debit note covers. Receipt lines therefore do NOT net returns away, because a
return against an already fully billed receipt would be netted against nothing
and vanish — and on this data some returns name no receipt at all.

Landed Cost Voucher charges are shown per document wherever any were applied.
They are the charges recorded on the document as a whole, not a share of the
unbilled remainder, and they sit in their own column rather than inside the
purchase value, because a Landed Cost Voucher posts to stock valuation and not
to the supplier bill.

HOW THE INVOICE HALF RELATES TO CORE'S PURCHASE REGISTER
---------------------------------------------------------
Both total an invoice from its item rows rather than its header, so they agree
on most data and did so exactly for July on production. They can still differ,
and the reason is worth knowing before anyone reconciles the two.

Core folds a Purchase Taxes and Charges row into its net_total when the row is
categorised Total and its ACCOUNT HEAD also happens to be used as an item
expense account somewhere in the same filtered set — a Deduct row arriving as a
negative. Whether a given charge lands in net_total or in its own tax column
therefore depends on the mix of invoices on screen, so core's net_total is not
a fixed definition of purchase value. On UAT that pulls three Customs Clearance
charges (55.56 in July) out of core's total while leaving Customs Duty and
Freight in tax columns.

This report always reports the same thing: the goods value on the bill, the sum
of the item rows. It does not move when the filters change.
