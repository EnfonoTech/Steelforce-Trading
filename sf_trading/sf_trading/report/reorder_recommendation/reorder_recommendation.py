# apps/sf_trading/sf_trading/report/reorder_recommendation/reorder_recommendation.py
"""Reorder Recommendation - what each item's reorder level and quantity should be, read from
what actually sold and what was actually purchased between two dates.

Nothing on this site has a reorder level set: `Item Reorder` is empty, and lead_time_days,
safety_stock and min_order_qty are zero on every item. So this report does not check work
against a configured plan - it proposes the plan, per item and per warehouse, from the
transactions themselves.

    Demand           = quantity that left the warehouse to a customer (Sales Invoice, Delivery
                       Note) net of returns, plus Material Issue consumption if that box is
                       ticked
    Average Daily    = demand / every day in the window, not only the days it moved
    Variability      = standard deviation of the daily demand, counting quiet days as zero
    Lead Time        = days from Purchase Order to Purchase Receipt for that item where the
                       history shows it, otherwise the item's own lead time, otherwise the
                       Default Lead Time filter
    Safety Stock     = Z x Variability x sqrt(Lead Time)      Z comes from the Service Level
    Reorder Level    = Average Daily x Lead Time + Safety Stock
    Order Up To      = Reorder Level + Average Daily x Coverage Days
    Reorder Qty      = Order Up To - Projected Qty, never below zero

Transfers between the company's own warehouses are left out of both sides. On this site they
move more quantity than sales do - 274,782 units out and the same 274,782 back in over ninety
days - so counting them would make every branch look like it were selling several times what it
sells, and would order stock that is already in the building.

Projected Qty, not Actual Qty, drives the recommendation: stock already on a purchase order is
coming, and stock already reserved against a sales order is spoken for. Ordering against actual
qty orders twice whatever is in transit.
