"""Loyalty Rewards Report — every reward booked to the reward account, from both sides.

Steel Force does not use ERPNext's Loyalty Program (there are no Loyalty Program or
Loyalty Point Entry records). A "loyalty reward" is whatever lands on the account the
**`Loyalty Reward Entry` Journal Entry Template** posts to
(`52010300019 - Loyalty Rewards - SFB` on the live site). It gets there two ways:

* **Journal Entry** — created from the template, debiting the reward account and crediting
  petty cash / bank. The journal carries no party, so the customer is only knowable through
  the invoice named on each Accounts row (`Journal Entry Account-custom_loyalty_sales_invoice`).
  One journal may therefore reward several invoices, belonging to different customers — one
  report row per debit row, the same shape the payment side has always had. The old header
  field is read as a fallback for the journals booked before the row field existed. A debit row
  with no invoice is still listed, with blank invoice / customer columns, and the
  **Only Unlinked** filter isolates those rows so an accountant can attach the invoice by hand;
  the **Row #** column says which grid row to open.
* **Payment Entry** — the collection itself carries the reward as a row in the PE's
  **Deductions or Loss** table on that same account (the counter waives the fils-level
  remainder). Here the customer and the invoice are known exactly: the PE's party plus its
  **Payment References** allocation. One row per allocated invoice, with the allocated amount
  next to the reward. When a payment settles several invoices the reward follows the
  allocation shares and the last invoice absorbs the rounding remainder, so the rows still
  add up to the deduction.

The account list comes from the template itself, so re-pointing the template moves both
sides of the report with it. The **Source** filter isolates either side.

Two shapes, switched by the "Summarise by Customer" filter:
  * detail  — one row per reward voucher (per allocated invoice for payments)
  * summary — one row per customer: vouchers, invoices, reward split by source, invoice value, %

Reads are batched: one query for journals, one for their account rows, one joined query for
payment deductions, one for the payment allocations, one for the invoices. No per-row lookups,
no SQL strings.
