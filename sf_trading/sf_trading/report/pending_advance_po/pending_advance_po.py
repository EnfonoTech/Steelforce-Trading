"""Purchase Orders carrying a supplier advance that no invoice has been booked against.

Where the advance comes from
----------------------------
`Purchase Order.advance_paid` is a denormalised figure ERPNext refreshes from the
`Advance Payment Ledger Entry` table: `set_total_advance_paid` calls
`calculate_total_advance_from_ledger`, which sums the APLE rows whose
`against_voucher_no` is the order. Nothing is written to `GL Entry` or `Payment
Ledger Entry` against a Purchase Order, so APLE is the only ledger that knows an
order-level advance exists -- querying either of the other two returns nothing and
makes it look as though no advance was ever paid.

This report reads the stored field, because that is what the order form shows, and a
figure nobody can reconcile against the document is worse than no figure. It re-sums
APLE alongside it and reports any disagreement in Remarks rather than quietly
preferring one source, since the field is only as fresh as the last time ERPNext
refreshed it.

Currency
--------
`advance_paid` is denominated in `party_account_currency` -- the supplier control
account's currency -- while `grand_total` is in the order's own currency. The two are
not comparable when they differ, so the order value is reported in the company's
currency next to the advance, and in the order's own currency separately. Without
that, an order raised in SAR and paid for in full up front reads as roughly a tenth
of a BHD advance.

Current state only
------------------
APLE carries no posting date, so an order's advance cannot be rebuilt as of a past
date the way the other open-item reports rebuild billing state. The From/To window
therefore bounds the *order date*, and the advance is always its balance right now.
