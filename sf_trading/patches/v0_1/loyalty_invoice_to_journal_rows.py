# apps/sf_trading/sf_trading/patches/v0_1/loyalty_invoice_to_journal_rows.py
"""Copy the header loyalty Sales Invoice link onto the journal's debit rows.

The link moved from `Journal Entry.custom_loyalty_sales_invoice` to
`Journal Entry Account.custom_loyalty_sales_invoice` so one journal can reward invoices belonging
to different customers. The journals booked before the move carry the header link only; without
this they would read as unlinked in the Loyalty Rewards Report.

Where a legacy journal has several debit rows, the header link was by definition the one invoice
for the whole voucher, so every debit row gets it. Nothing is double counted: each row keeps its
own debit as its reward, and the report's summary adds each invoice's value once through a set.

The field is created here as well as shipped as a fixture, because `bench migrate` runs
post_model_sync patches during the schema updates and only calls `sync_fixtures()` afterwards — on
the first migrate the column would not exist yet and this patch would silently do nothing.

Replay-safe: a row that already carries a link is skipped, and the whole patch no-ops on a site
that never had the header field. Writes go through `frappe.db.set_value(..., update_modified=False)`
— no document is loaded, so no validation fires on the submitted journals and none of them look
edited afterwards.
