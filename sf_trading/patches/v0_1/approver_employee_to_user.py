"""Approver moved from Employee to User on Payment Advice and Payment Automation Settings.

The field used to link an Employee, and submission compared the session user against that
Employee's User ID. An approver whose Employee carried no User ID could therefore be selected and
then nobody could submit the advice. The field is now the user itself.

Stored values are Employee names, so they are translated here: Employee -> user_id. An Employee with
no linked user cannot be translated; the value is cleared and named in the Error Log, because
leaving an Employee name in a User link shows as a broken link and would never match a session user.
A value that is not an Employee name is already a user and is left alone, so a replay is a no-op.
