"""Rename "Invoice Due & Overdue Report" -> "Invoice Due and Overdue Report".

Frappe derives a Script Report's python module from its NAME, so an ampersand produced
`sf_trading.sf_trading.report.invoice_due_&_overdue_report`, which is not an importable module.
Opening the report in the desk failed with ModuleNotFoundError; only direct execute() calls
worked, which is how it slipped through.
