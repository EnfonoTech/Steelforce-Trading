"""Open item engine — the four unbilled/undelivered flows.

A sales or purchase document row stays "open" until its counterpart document
row closes it. The links that pair rows up are core's own mapper fields:

    Sales Invoice Item.dn_detail        -> Delivery Note Item.name   (bill after delivery)
    Delivery Note Item.si_detail        -> Sales Invoice Item.name   (deliver after billing)
    Purchase Invoice Item.pr_detail     -> Purchase Receipt Item.name (bill after receipt)
    Purchase Receipt Item.purchase_invoice_item -> Purchase Invoice Item.name (receive after billing)

Every report here reconstructs the matched quantity from those links as of a
date, instead of reading the live denormalised fields (`billed_amt`,
`delivered_qty`, `per_received`). The live fields only know today's state, so
"open as of 30 June" comes out wrong through them — the linked rows carry
their own posting dates and do not have that problem. It also means a row
whose counterpart was cancelled re-opens by itself.

Returns net the same way: a return document's rows point at the original row
(`sales_invoice_item` / `dn_detail` / `purchase_receipt_item` /
`purchase_invoice_item`) with negative quantities.

Used by the four Script Reports in sf_trading/report/:
    Invoiced Items To Be Delivered
    Delivered Items Pending Billing
    Received Items Pending Billing
    Billed Items Pending Receipt
